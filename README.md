./target/release/music_player music
```

### Navigation Tips

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test script
./test.sh

# Or run individual Rust tests
cargo test
```

### Dependencies
- **rodio** - Audio playback engine
- **ratatui** + **crossterm** - Terminal UI framework
- **mp3-duration** - Accurate MP3 duration extraction
- **anyhow** - Error handling
- **walkdir** - Directory traversal
- **ctrlc** - Signal handling

## Troubleshooting

**"No such file or directory"**
- Ensure the path exists and contains supported audio files
- Check file permissions

**"Failed to decode audio file"**
- File may be corrupted or in an unsupported format
- Try converting to MP3 or another supported format

**"No audio device found"**
- Ensure your system has working audio output
- Check audio drivers and system audio settings

**Build fails**
- Update Rust: `rustup update`
- Clear cache: `cargo clean && cargo build`
